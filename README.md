<h1>Liri Bot<h1>

<h2>What it Does<h2>

The project is build a search engine or API designed to give back information that is requested by the user. 

This search engine is limited to finding information about songs, movies and concerts. 

<h3>Spotify a Song<h3>

Using the command *spotify-this* we can enter a song name and get back:

    1. The song's name.

    2. A preview link of the song from Spotify.

    3. The album that the song is from.

If we don't enter a name of a song, the search results default to results for the "The Sign" by Ace of Base.

Using the command *movie-this* we can enter a movie's name and get back:

    1.  Title of the movie.

    2.  Year the movie came out.

    3.  IMDB Rating of the movie.

    4.  Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie.

    5.  Country where the movie was produced.

    6.  Language of the movie.

<h6>Do What It Says<h6>

In addition to just directly typing in songs, movie or artist's names in termina, we added a random.txt file where you can write down these things and get the results by typing in *do-what-it-says*.

This project is useful because it allows you to get the data you need when researching a movie to help narrow down your choices.

If you remember the name of a song but don't know which artist sang it or which album it's from- you can search that too. 

You can find out when and where the latest concerts are where your favorite band is performing.
